# Markdown Notes

## Markdown Cheatsheet

There is a lot of tags that Markdown uses and many parsers use a standard set and often add on to them. Since we will be using most of our Markdown on Github here is a subset of the most prolific items that works there:

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.

## How Can I Edit Markdown?

Well you can easily edit Markdown with any text editor like Notepad, VSCode, Sublime, etc. However, many IDEs have built in previewing of the document allowing you to see somewhat how the text will render when ran through a parser that turns the Markdown into a prettier format.

## Why Use It?

### It’s Easy to Learn and Fast to Use

Markdown is dead simple to learn. Simple in text editing added to your regular writing can change the way that document functions. For example, this:

    - List item 1

    - List item 2

    - List item 3

Becomes, this:

- List item 1

- List item 2

- List item 3

So typing Markdown is almost always faster than writing with a rich text editor, especially when you start getting into things like links or bulleted lists, which either make you use the mouse or force you to memorize a complicated sequence of keyboard shortcuts. One caveat is that if you need complicated text elements, such as tables, you’re better off sticking to HTML. Fortunately, Markdown has full HTML support, so you can code a table in HTML and go right back to Markdown in the same document.

Plus, it’s much easier to read raw Markdown than it is to read raw HTML. Which, you know, was part of the reason Markdown was even invented.

### Markdown is Futureproof

By “futureproof,” we mean that Markdown is a plain text format. For as long as plain text is the standard (which it will be for a long, long time), Markdown will be usable and openable by modern programs. Compare this to Microsoft Word, which has 8 different filetypes as of 2018. Keeping things plain text ensures there will never be an outdated version, so software doesn’t need to update to keep up with the format.

Markdown does have its own filename extension: .md, but it was designed to be perfectly readable as a raw text file. So it’s safe to say that Markdown isn’t going anywhere.

### It’s Used Everywhere

You might expect that Markdown’s use has stalled as rich text becomes more and more popular, but that’s actually incorrect. Markdown’s presence has only grown since its introduction, and it continues to do so.

Markdown is the unofficial standard on popular coding sites such as GitHub. It is also the default formatting option for popular communication tools such as Skype, Slack, and (to a lesser extent) Facebook Messenger. Wikipedia even uses a modified Markdown syntax they call wikitext.

In a world of social coding that’s only becoming more social, the programmer who doesn’t know Markdown will find themselves at a disadvantage (or, at the very least, confused for a little while).

So learn Markdown, if for no other reason than so you can keep up with the industry.
