### Presentation Evaluation Submission


# Presentation Expectations
Each student will present their topic with a slide deck that will go over the basics of the topic. Each presentation should be practiced and timed to last 20 minutes. Going over or under the time limit will result in a hit on the credit for the course. Each presentation should also be as informative and comprehensive as possible. The presenter will be evaluated by each student based on the rubric posted above and the totals from the students will factor into the final grade received for the presentation. The graders participation will also factor into their final grade on the presentation. Comment period for each presentation will be no longer than five minutes and discussions for each presentation will be available through the Signup Form google document above with a Q&A style. Presenters will be expected to answer questions posted to the document for 1 week following their presentation. Comments posted on the Evaluation will be shared privately with the presenter as well.
