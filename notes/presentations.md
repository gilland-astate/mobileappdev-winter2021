# Presentation Expectations
Each student will present their topic with a slide deck that will go over the basics of the topic. Each presentation should be practiced and timed to last 20 minutes. Going over or under the time limit will result in a hit on the credit for the course. Each presentation should also be as informative and comprehensive as possible. The presenter will be evaluated by each student based on the rubric posted above and the totals from the students will factor into the final grade received for the presentation. The graders participation will also factor into their final grade on the presentation. Comment period for each presentation will be no longer than five minutes and discussions for each presentation will be available through the Signup Form google document above with a Q&A style. Presenters will be expected to answer questions posted to the document for 1 week following their presentation. Comments posted on the Evaluation will be shared privately with the presenter as well.

# Presentation Description

### Selecting your Programming Language: Java vs Kotlin
* Slides 
    * https://github.com/gilland-astate/mobileappdev-winter2021/blob/main/resources/KotlinVsJava.pptx
* Pros & Cons of Each Language
* Short overview of how Kotlin changes Java for the better. (Tell me what each of these mean and how they help me as a developer)
    * "auto" style inference
    * Exception Handling (This is a pro & con)
    * Null Safe
    * Functional Programming
    * "data"
    * Extendability
    * Smart Casting
    * Co-Routines
* Demonstrate how Android Studio can convert Java to Kotlin, but there are caveats (You won't be able to recognize these, but see if you can find some information on the pitfalls of doing automatic conversion)

### Android Studio IDE Overview
* A quick install guide would be helpful, as well as where to find all of the relevant items you will need.
* Show how to use the IDE to place view components.
* The next presentation will talk about the structure of the program however knowing how to navigate the IDE in those areas may be helpful.
* Knowing some keyboard shortcuts for various needed functions or cheatsheets would be helpful. (Do your research don't give me the first cheatsheet on google unless its good!)
* Show us around the VCS (version control)
* Show how gradle works in the IDE (again remember the next presentation will go into some of these things)
* Explore pitfalls when working on projects as a team with the IDE (Not sure if there are any but maybe do a bit of digging to see if there are any complaints)
* Compile a "hello,world" style app and walk us through how to do so and what that looks like? (This one isn't necessary, but could be a nice quick glance at the process)


### Android Project Structure: Code, XML, Build Instruction Files
* This one is going to be either really easy or really hard to stay below 20 minutes.
* I want detailed info about all of the different aspects of how an Android Project should be structured.
* Best practices on where to store things in the IDE properly, how to manage your file structure and how to best name and categorize files.
* Best practices on storing configuration data when needed to pass for runtime to runtime.
* Using gradle and what build instruction files are for.
* Dependancy management and what needs to happen when you add additional dependancies (#includes in C terms)

### Activity Lifecycle
* What Are Activities - Quick rundown on what they are and what we need them for.
* Explain this image in detail and why this matters:
