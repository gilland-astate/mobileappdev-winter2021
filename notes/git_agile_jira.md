# Source Control -- Git 
### Read Thoroughly
* https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/ -- The Git Handbook, this will talk about what source control is. What git specifically is and how to use it. Please read this an understand most of the basic commands for how Git works and Functions.
* https://learngitbranching.js.org/ -- This is an interactive tutorial and walkthrough on using Git. Please complete the first 1-4 steps. If you would like to go further that is up to you.
### Advanced Topics on Versioning - Read if you are interested
We will go through versioning your project later on and conventions I expect to be utilized. However, this is a great topic for project management and something to think about when pursuing a career in this field with user facing products.
* https://travishorn.com/semantic-versioning-with-git-tags-1ef2d4aeede6 - Semantic versioning
* https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ - Git-Flow versioning model
* https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ - GUI application for Git that supports git-flow versioning

# Project Management - JIRA - Skim is fine
We will be utilizing JIRA as our project tracking/management tool. We will be using most of the features of the software and we will go more in-depth later on how to use these tools and what I will expect from team members. However, please skim some of the links and familiarize yourself with the different features and why we use them. I have several links below to help you do so.
* https://www.atlassian.com/project-management-software -- Main Product page for JIRA
* https://www.atlassian.com/project-management -- An introduction to using JIRA for project management.
* https://blog.hubstaff.com/jira-project-management-guide-beginners/ -- A more in-depth look at using JIRA for your project.

# Agile Development and Tools
Most of this you can simply skim, but when I talk about certain terms please be familiar with those at the very least.
* https://www.atlassian.com/agile -- Super short skim, just familiarize yourself with what Agile is if you don't already know.
* https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum -- We won't be using scrums in particular, however some information in this may help to lead your group in the right direction.
* https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban -- We will be using Kanban boards for our projects. Please at least understand what a Kanban board looks like and how it functions so that when it comes up you have a reference.
* https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/git -- This is a good article on how Git fits in with agile development. Not required reading.
* https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories - This is a good guide on writing proper user stories. We will talk more about this on Monday.

# Android Studio - Java/Kotlin
We will be utilizing Android Studio for our project. Please try to take the time to install the software as well as an emulator for Android. I have included some links to the installation location, some documentation on installing emulators for Android and what to choose. 
* https://developer.android.com/studio -- Downloading and installing Android Studio is pretty straightforward. This is an extremely well developed and well documented software. It is a bit bloated for an IDE, but it's also extremely comprehensive.
* https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator -- As part of the installation it should walk you through installing an android emulator. However, if it doesn't please refer to this link or also if you have questions on how the emulator works.
* https://hackr.io/blog/kotlin-vs-java -- One of the first things you will need to decide when programming for Android is which language you will use. I will personally recommend Kotlin, but the beauty of Android development is that Kotlin and Java are interchangeable. So, even within the same project you can have both files. I would suggest that a group picks one and unanimously sticks with it. So, familiarize yourself with the differences so that you will be comfortable making the arugment for your side of that coin.
* https://firebase.google.com/ -- This was the piece of software I was desperately trying to think of on Wednesday. It's a great tool that plugs right into Android Studio development and eases the strain on getting certain items up and going quickly. So, familiarize yourself with some of the functionality. The more tools in your tool belt the easier it is not to reinvent the wheel.

# Final Word
Please take the time to read over these. We will talk about them in class, but for the most part we will probably gloss over these links in general, but I will expect you to know the terminology without having to repeat myself constantly.

Also, please be start adding your ideas. You are more than welcome to add multiple ideas, but please make sure not to delete anyone else's or overwrite them. You can find the google document here:
